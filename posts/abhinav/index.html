            >Researchers have been working</a

          to make mind-controlled prosthetics a reality for at least a decade.
          In theory, an artificial hand that amputees could control with their
          mind could restore their ability to carry out all sorts of daily
          tasks, and dramatically improve their standard of living.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, until now scientists have faced a major barrier: they haven’t
          been able to access nerve signals that are strong or stable enough to
          send to the bionic limb. Although it’s possible to get this sort of
          signal using a
          <a
            href="https://www.technologyreview.com/humans-and-technology/brain-computer-interface/"
            target="_blank"
            >brain-machine interface</a
          >, the procedure to implant one is invasive and costly. And the nerve
          signals carried by the peripheral nerves that fan out from the brain
          and spinal cord are too small.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          A new implant gets around this problem by using machine learning to
          amplify these signals. A study, published in
          <a
            href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aay2857"
            >Science Translational Medicine</a
          >
          today, found that it worked for four amputees for almost a year. It
          gave them fine control of their prosthetic hands and let them pick up
          miniature play bricks, grasp items like soda cans, and play Rock,
          Paper, Scissors.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s the first time researchers have recorded millivolt signals from a
          nerve—far stronger than any previous study.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The strength of this signal allowed the researchers to train
          algorithms to translate them into movements. “The first time we
          switched it on, it worked immediately,” says Paul Cederna, a
          biomechanics professor at the University of Michigan,
          <a
            href="https://spotlight.engin.umich.edu/mind-control-prosthesis/"
            target="_blank"
            >who co-led the study</a
          >. “There was no gap between thought and movement.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure for the implant requires one of the amputee’s peripheral
          nerves to be cut and stitched up to the muscle. The site heals,
          developing nerves and blood vessels over three months. Electrodes are
          then implanted into these sites, allowing a nerve signal to be
          recorded and passed on to a prosthetic hand in real time. The signals
          are turned into movements using machine-learning algorithms (the same
          types that are used for brain-machine interfaces).
        </p>
        <p>
          Amputees wearing the prosthetic hand were able to control each
          individual finger and swivel their thumbs, regardless of how recently
          they had lost their limb. Their nerve signals were recorded for a few
          minutes to calibrate the algorithms to their individual signals, but
          after that each implant worked straight away, without any need to
          recalibrate during the 300 days of testing, according to study
          co-leader Cynthia Chestek, an associate professor in biomedical
          engineering at the University of Michigan.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s just a proof-of-concept study, so it requires further testing to
          validate the results. The researchers are recruiting amputees for an
          ongoing clinical trial, funded by DARPA and the National Institutes of
          Health.&nbsp;
