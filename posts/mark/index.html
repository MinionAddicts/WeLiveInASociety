                <p> Artificial intelligence has been helping us in various applications such as customer service, trading and healthcare. And now, researchers have found that AI can be used to predict natural disasters. With enormous amounts of good quality datasets, AI can predict the occurrence of numerous natural disasters, which can be the difference between life and death for thousands of people. Some of the natural disasters that can be predicted by AI are:</p>

                <h2> Earthquakes </h2>
                <p> Researchers are collecting enormous amounts of seismic data for analysis using deep learning systems. Artificial intelligence can use the seismic data to analyze the magnitude and patterns of earthquakes. Such data can prove beneficial to predict the occurrence of earthquakes. For example, Google and Harvard are developing an AI system that can predict the aftershocks of an earthquake. Scientists have studied more than 131,000 earthquakes and aftershocks to build a neural network. The researchers tested the neural network on 30,000 events, and the system predicted the aftershock locations more precisely when compared to traditional methods.</p>

                <h2> Floods </h2>
                <p> Google is building an AI platform to predict floods in India and warn users via Google Maps and Google Search. The data for training the AI system is collected with the help of rainfall records and flood simulations. Similarly, researchers are developing AI-based systems that can learn from rainfall and climate records and tested with flood simulations, which can predict floods better than the traditional systems. Alternatively, AI can also be used to monitor urban flooding. Researchers at the University of Dundee in the United Kingdom are monitoring urban flooding by collecting crowd-sourced data with Twitter and other mobile apps. The data contains images and information about the location and situations in a locality, which is recognized by the AI. Such systems can be used to monitor and predict the damage done by floods along with other methods. Likewise, applications based on artificial intelligence and deep learning is useful for disaster management.</p>

                <h2> Volcanic eruptions </h2>
                <p> Researchers have always struggled with finding methods to effectively predict natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions. But now, scientists are training AI to recognize tiny ash particles from volcanoes. The shape of the ash particles can be used to identify the type of volcano. Such developments can help in predicting eruptions and creating volcanic hazard mitigation techniques.

                IBM is developing Watson that will predict volcanic eruptions using seismic sensors and geological data. IBM is aiming to forecast the locations and the intensity of eruptions with the help of Watson. Such applications can help to prevent the loss of life in areas surrounding active volcanoes.</p>
