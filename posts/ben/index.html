                <p> The technology on display in Tokyo suggests that the future of elite athletic 
                    training lies not merely in gathering data about the human body, but in using 
                    that data to create digital replicas of it. These avatars could one day run through 
                    hypothetical scenarios to help athletes decide which choices will produce the best outcomes.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 py-3 justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-xl-7">
                <p> The tracking system being used in Tokyo, an Intel product called 3DAT, feeds 
                    live footage into the cloud. There, an artificial intelligence program uses deep 
                    learning to analyze an athlete’s movements and identifies key performance characteristics 
                    such as top speed and deceleration.The system shares that information with viewers by 
                    displaying slow-motion graphic representations of the action, highlighting key moments. 
                    The whole process, from capturing the footage to broadcasting the analysis, takes less than 30 seconds.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, during NBC ’s broadcast of the 100 meter trials in Eugene, Ore., the AI showed how Sha'Carri 
                    Richardson hit 24.1 miles per hour at her peak and slowed to 20.0 mph by the time she reached the finish line. 
                    That was enough to win the race: Richardson ’s runner-up hit a maximum speed of 23.2 miles per hour and slowed 
                    to 20.4 mph at the line.
                    <br><br>
                    “It ’s like having your own personal commentator point things out to you in the race,” says Jonathan Lee, director 
                    of sports performance technology in the Olympic technology group at Intel.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xl-3">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="../res/img/ben_post_content.jpg">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 py-3 justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-xl-10">
                <p> To train their Olympic AI via machine learning, Lee and his team had to capture as much 
                    footage of elite track and field athletes in motion as they could. They needed recordings 
                    of human bodies performing specific moves, but the preexisting footage used for similar 
                    research shows average people in motion, which would have confused the algorithm, Lee says. 
                    “People aren’t usually fully horizontal seven feet in the air,” he notes, but world-class 
                    high jumpers reach such heights regularly.
                    <br><br>
                    In the footage, a team at Intel manually annotated every part of the body—eyes, nose, shoulders, 
                    and more—pixel by pixel. Once those key points were identified, the model could begin connecting 
                    them in three dimensions until it had a simplified rendering of an athlete ’s form. Tracking 
                    this “skeleton” enables the program to perform 3-D pose estimation (a computer vision technique 
                    that tracks an object and tries to predict the changes it might undergo in space) on the athlete 
                    ’s body as it moves through an event.
                    <br><br>
                    The tracking system is limited to the track-and-field events at this year ’s games. But similar 
                    technology could become standard in a variety of sports, suggests Barbara Rita Barricelli, who 
                    is a human-computer interaction researcher and assistant professor at Italy ’s University of 
                    Brescia and is not involved with the Intel project. “The real big shift is when a technology is 
                    not only used for entertainment or research, but is accepted by the community of practice,” Barricelli 
                    says. For example, when video-assistant referees were first used in soccer, they were popular with 
                    broadcast networks—but some human referees refused to rely on them for game-changing decisions. 
                    The technology remains controversial, but now many officials routinely use the video assistant to help 
                    make a call. Baricelli suggests 3DAT ’s Olympic debut may be “a big step for research meeting 
                    practice—or better, practice embracing research results.”</p>
